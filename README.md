# My Personal Project

## Description

This application aims to take the user's plan of meals for the chosen time period, and creates a shopping list, taking into consideration each item's expiration date.

For example, the person wants to have groceries for the next two weeks, and the user chooses the meals they want to have that 2 weeks, and the application makes two groceries lists (because selected things only had 1 and 2-week expiration dates).
One list will contain groceries with an expiration date of 2 weeks, and the second list will contain things that have an expiration date of 1 week.


## Who can use this application?

This application is meant to be used by everyone, from students to family households, so it can ease the job of taking care of food and reduce its waste in these settings.

This project started as an idea to help students collect items for their weekly and monthly grocery shopping runs, to help them save money and reduce food waste.
